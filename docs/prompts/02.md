Task: Integrate MongoDB connection logic into the bot from Prompt 1.
Requirements:
1.  Add the `mongodb` npm package.
2.  Create a configuration file/module (`config.js`) that reads `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DB_NAME` from environment variables (`.env`).
3.  Create a database connection module (`db.js` or `lib/mongo.js`).
    -   It should export an async function `connectDB` that connects to MongoDB using the URI from config.
    -   It should handle connection errors gracefully (log and potentially exit).
    -   It should store the connected client or db instance for reuse.
    -   It should export a function `getDB` to retrieve the db instance.
4.  Call `connectDB` in the main bot file (`index.js`) after login, before starting command handling. Ensure the bot waits for the connection before proceeding.
5.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/db.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Use `mongodb-memory-server` (add as dev dependency) to spin up an in-memory MongoDB for testing.
-   Test that `connectDB` successfully connects to the in-memory server.
-   Test that `getDB` returns a valid DB instance after connection.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test` and exit cleanly.
