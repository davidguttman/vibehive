Task: Implement a stub for the `/add-repo` slash command.
Requirements:
1.  Modify the bot's command registration logic (likely from Prompt 1) to register a new slash command `/add-repo`.
2.  The command should have one required string option: `url`.
3.  Modify the interaction handler:
    -   Check if the interaction `commandName` is `add-repo`.
    -   Check if the user invoking the command has Administrator permissions (`interaction.member.permissions.has(PermissionsBitField.Flags.Administrator)`). If not, reply with an error message and return.
    -   If admin, retrieve the value of the `url` option.
    -   Reply with a temporary acknowledgement message like "Received request to add repo: [URL]".
4.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/add-repo-command.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Mock the `interaction` object.
-   Test that non-admins receive a permission error reply.
-   Test that admins receive the acknowledgement reply, including the passed URL.
-   Verify the handler correctly identifies the command and extracts the option.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
