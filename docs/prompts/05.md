Task: Enhance the `/add-repo` command to store repository information in MongoDB.
Requirements:
1.  Modify the `/add-repo` command handler (from Prompt 4).
2.  After checking admin permissions and retrieving the `url`:
    -   Get the `channelId` from the `interaction` object (`interaction.channelId`).
    -   Import the `Repository` model (from Prompt 3). Query the database to find a repository document matching the `channelId`.
    -   Use the model to create or update (upsert might be suitable, or find-and-update) a document in the `repositories` collection. Store the `repoUrl` and `discordChannelId`. Handle potential database errors (e.g., duplicate channel ID if not using upsert).
    -   Reply to the user confirming the repository configuration has been saved (e.g., "Repository configuration for [URL] saved for this channel."). Include error reporting if the save fails.
3.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Modify `test/add-repo-command.test.js` or create a new test file.
-   Use the in-memory MongoDB server.
-   Mock the `interaction` object with admin permissions, a channel ID, and a URL.
-   After simulating the command execution, assert that a corresponding document exists in the database with the correct `repoUrl` and `discordChannelId`.
-   Test error handling for database failures (e.g., mock the model's save/update method to throw an error).
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test` and the database is clean after tests.
