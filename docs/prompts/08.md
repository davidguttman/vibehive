Task: Implement logic to handle bot mentions and trigger the Python wrapper.
Requirements:
1.  In the main bot file (`index.js`), add a handler for the `messageCreate` event from `discord.js`.
2.  Inside the handler:
    -   Ignore messages from bots (including itself).
    -   Check if the bot was mentioned in the message content (`message.mentions.has(client.user)`).
    -   If mentioned, extract the message content, removing the mention itself to get the user's prompt string. Trim whitespace.
    -   Get the `channelId` from the message (`message.channelId`).
    -   Import the `Repository` model (Prompt 3). Query the database to find a repository document matching the `channelId`.
    -   If no repository is found for the channel, reply politely indicating the channel isn't configured and return.
    -   If a repository is found:
        -   Import and call the `invokeAiderWrapper` function (Prompt 7) with the extracted prompt.
        -   (For now, just log the result or error. Output display will be in the next step).
3.  Ensure the bot has the necessary Intents enabled (e.g., `GatewayIntentBits.Guilds`, `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages`, `GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent`). Update the client initialization if needed. Remember `MessageContent` is privileged.
4.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/mentionHandler.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Use the in-memory MongoDB. Seed it with a test repository document.
-   Mock the `message` object and `client.user`.
-   Test case 1 (No Mention): Simulate a message without mentioning the bot. Assert the wrapper is *not* called.
-   Test case 2 (Mention, No Repo): Simulate a mention in a channel *not* in the DB. Assert the wrapper is *not* called and a specific reply is sent.
-   Test case 3 (Mention, Repo Found): Simulate a mention in a channel *with* a configured repo. Assert that `invokeAiderWrapper` is called with the correctly extracted prompt. Mock `invokeAiderWrapper` to verify it's called.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
