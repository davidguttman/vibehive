Task: Implement slash commands for managing context files.
Requirements:
1.  Register three new slash commands:
    -   `/files`: No options.
    -   `/add`: One required string option `paths` (Description: Space-separated file paths).
    -   `/drop`: One required string option `paths` (Description: Space-separated file paths).
2.  In the interaction handler:
    -   Handle `files` command:
        -   Find the repository document for the `interaction.channelId`. If none, reply error.
        -   Retrieve the `contextFiles` array.
        -   Reply with the list of files, nicely formatted (e.g., in a code block or numbered list), or "No files currently in context."
    -   Handle `add` command:
        -   Find the repository document for the `interaction.channelId`. If none, reply error.
        -   Get the `paths` string option. Split it by spaces to get an array of potential file paths. Filter out empty strings.
        -   Perform basic validation (e.g., reject paths starting with `/` or containing `..`). Reply with error for invalid paths.
        -   Update the repository document by adding the valid new paths to the `contextFiles` array (avoid duplicates). Use MongoDB's `$addToSet` with `$each`.
        -   Reply confirming which files were added.
    -   Handle `drop` command:
        -   Find the repository document for the `interaction.channelId`. If none, reply error.
        -   Get the `paths` string option. Split it by spaces.
        -   Update the repository document by removing the specified paths from the `contextFiles` array. Use MongoDB's `$pull` with `$in`.
        -   Reply confirming which files were removed (or indicate if they weren't found).
3.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/contextCommands.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Use in-memory MongoDB. Seed with a test repository.
-   Mock the `interaction` object for each command.
-   Test `/files`: Assert the reply contains the expected files from the seeded document.
-   Test `/add`: Assert the DB document is updated correctly (files added, duplicates ignored). Test validation rejects bad paths. Verify reply message.
-   Test `/drop`: Assert the DB document is updated correctly (files removed). Verify reply message.
-   Test commands fail gracefully if no repo is configured for the channel.
-   Mock `interaction.reply`.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
