Task: Modify the `/add-repo` command to accept, encrypt, and store an SSH private key attachment.
Requirements:
1.  Modify the `/add-repo` slash command registration (Prompt 4) to add a required `attachment` option named `ssh_key`.
2.  Modify the `/add-repo` command handler (Prompt 5):
    -   After permission checks, retrieve the `ssh_key` attachment option from the interaction (`interaction.options.getAttachment('ssh_key')`).
    -   Check the attachment's content type (e.g., `text/plain` or common key file types, though validation might be loose initially) and size if needed. Reply with an error if invalid.
    -   Fetch the attachment content using its URL (`attachment.url`). Use `node-fetch` or Node's built-in `fetch` (v18+). Handle fetch errors.
    -   Read the fetched content as text (the private key).
    -   Import the `encrypt` function (Prompt 13). Encrypt the key text.
    -   When saving/updating the `Repository` document, store the encrypted key string in the `encryptedSshKey` field.
    -   Update the confirmation message to indicate the key was received and stored securely.
3.  Add `node-fetch` if Node version < 18.
4.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Modify `test/add-repo-command.test.js`.
-   Set a dummy `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
-   Mock the `interaction` object, including `options.getAttachment` to return a mock attachment object with a URL.
-   Mock `fetch` to return a fake SSH key string when called with the mock URL.
-   Mock the `encrypt` function or use the real one.
-   Assert that the `Repository` model's save/update method is called with the correctly encrypted key data.
-   Test error handling for fetch failures and invalid attachments.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
