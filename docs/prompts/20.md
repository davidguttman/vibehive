Task: Assign a `coderX` user when adding a repository and store it.
Requirements:
1.  Modify `models/Repository.js` (from Prompt 14):
    -   Add a new field `assignedUserId`: { type: String }. Add an index if needed.
2.  Modify the `/add-repo` command handler (from Prompt 15):
    -   Define the pool of available user IDs (e.g., `['coder1', 'coder2', ..., 'coder5']`). This could be hardcoded or read from config/env.
    -   Before saving the new repository document, query the `repositories` collection to find which `assignedUserId`s are already in use.
    -   Select the first available ID from the pool that is not currently in use. If all are in use, reply with an error ("Maximum repository limit reached.").
    -   Store the selected ID in the `assignedUserId` field of the new repository document.
    -   Update the confirmation message to include the assigned user ID (for debugging/info).
3.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Modify `test/add-repo-command.test.js`.
-   Use in-memory MongoDB.
-   Test adding the first repo: Assert `assignedUserId` is 'coder1' (or the first in the pool).
-   Seed the DB with repos assigned to 'coder1', 'coder2'. Test adding another: Assert `assignedUserId` is 'coder3'.
-   Seed the DB with all user IDs assigned. Test adding another: Assert an error reply is sent and no new document is created.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
