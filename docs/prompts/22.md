Task: Clone the repository using Git when `/add-repo` is invoked.
Requirements:
1.  Modify the `/add-repo` command handler (from Prompt 20).
2.  After assigning `assignedUserId` and before saving the `Repository` document (or perhaps after saving, but before replying success):
    -   Import `decrypt` (Prompt 13), `writeTempKey`, `deleteTempKey` (Prompt 21), `path`, `fs/promises`, `child_process`.
    -   Get `baseDir` (Prompt 16). Define `repoName` (e.g., from URL or ID). Construct `repoPath = path.join(baseDir, repoName)`.
    -   Create the repository directory: `await fs.mkdir(repoPath, { recursive: true })`.
    -   Run `sudo -u ${assignedUserId} chown ${assignedUserId}:${assignedUserId} ${repoPath}` using `execFileSync`.
    -   Decrypt the SSH key (`repoConfig.encryptedSshKey`).
    -   Call `writeTempKey({ repoName, keyContent, ownerUserId: assignedUserId })`. Store `keyFilePath`.
    -   Construct `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` env var as in Prompt 17.
    -   Execute the clone command: Use `spawn` or `execFile` for `sudo -u ${assignedUserId} git clone ${repoUrl} .`
        -   Set the `cwd` to `repoPath`.
        -   Pass the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` in the `env` options (merged with `process.env`).
        -   Capture `stdout` and `stderr`. Wait for completion.
    -   Use a `try...finally` block around the clone operation.
    -   In `finally`, call `deleteTempKey({ repoName, ownerUserId: assignedUserId })`.
    -   If the `git clone` command fails (non-zero exit code or significant stderr), handle the error:
        -   Log the error details (`stderr`).
        -   Clean up: remove the created `repoPath` directory (`fs.rm(repoPath, { recursive: true, force: true })`).
        -   Do *not* save the `Repository` document (if not already saved), or delete it if already saved.
        -   Reply to the user with a specific error: "‚ùå Failed to clone repository. Please check the URL and SSH key permissions. Details logged."
    -   If clone succeeds, proceed to save the `Repository` document (if not already saved) and reply with success.
3.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Modify `test/add-repo-command.test.js`. This becomes more of an integration test.
-   Requires mocking `fs`, `child_process`, `decrypt`, `writeTempKey`, `deleteTempKey`.
-   Test success case: Mock `git clone` to exit 0. Assert `Repository.save` is called and success reply sent. Assert temp key is deleted. Assert repo dir and owner are set correctly.
-   Test clone failure case: Mock `git clone` to exit 1 with stderr. Assert `Repository.save` is *not* called (or doc is deleted), error reply is sent, temp key is deleted, repo dir is removed.
-   Use a test Git repository URL (can be fake).
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
