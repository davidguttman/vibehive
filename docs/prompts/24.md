Task: Detect File Changes: Enhance the Python wrapper to detect file changes made by `aider` and include them in the output.
Requirements:
1.  Modify `aider_wrapper.py` (from Prompt 23):
2.  Requires `gitpython` library: Add `GitPython` to `requirements.txt` and install it (`pip install`).
3.  Import `git`.
4.  Before `coder.run()`:
    -   Initialize `repo = git.Repo('.')` (assuming cwd is the repo root).
    -   Get the set of currently tracked files known to Git: `initial_files = set(item.path for item in repo.index.iter_blobs())`.
    -   Get the initial status/diff to detect modifications to tracked files: `initial_diff = repo.index.diff(None)` (unstaged changes). Store modified paths.
5.  After `coder.run()` completes successfully:
    -   Get the set of tracked files *after* the run: `final_files = set(item.path for item in repo.index.iter_blobs())`. This seems incorrect, need to check untracked/staged files too.
    -   *Alternative Approach:* Use `repo.git.status('--porcelain')` before and after `coder.run`. Parse the output to determine added (`??`), deleted (` D`), modified (` M`), etc. files. This is likely more reliable.
    -   Compare the before/after status.
    -   Iterate through detected changes:
        -   For modified/added files: Read the new content (`open(filepath).read()`). Generate a diff if possible/required by spec (`repo.git.diff('HEAD', filepath)` might work *after* staging, or compare content manually).
        -   For deleted files: Note the filename.
    -   In the JSON output's `events` array:
        -   For each change, add a `file_change` event object:
            ```json
            {
              "type": "file_change",
              "filename": "path/relative/to/repo/root.py",
              "change_type": "modified" | "added" | "deleted",
              "content": "...", // Full new content for added/modified, null for deleted
              "diff": "..."   // Standard diff output for modified, null otherwise
            }
            ```
6.  Refine the `overall_status` based on whether changes occurred. Add status messages.
Testing:
-   Modify `test/aider_wrapper.test.js`. This requires a test environment with a dummy Git repository.
-   Setup: Before running the wrapper script in the test, create a temporary directory, initialize git (`git init`), add and commit a file (`dummy.txt`).
-   Test case 1 (Modification): Run the wrapper script (mocking `coder.run` to simulate modifying `dummy.txt`). Assert the output JSON contains a `file_change` event for `dummy.txt` with `change_type: "modified"`, and includes `content` and/or `diff`.
-   Test case 2 (Addition): Mock `coder.run` to simulate creating a new file `new.txt`. Assert a `file_change` event for `new.txt` with `change_type: "added"` and `content`.
-   Test case 3 (Deletion): Mock `coder.run` to simulate deleting `dummy.txt`. Assert a `file_change` event for `dummy.txt` with `change_type: "deleted"`.
-   Clean up the temporary git directory.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
