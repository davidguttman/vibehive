Task: Integrate Queue: Integrate the queue manager into the bot's command handling.
Requirements:
1.  Refactor the core processing logic (find repo, invoke wrapper, handle output, git ops, reply) from the `@mention` handler (and potentially other command handlers if they become async tasks) into a separate async function, e.g., `executeAiderTask({ channelId, userId, prompt, originalInteractionOrMessage })`. This function will serve as the `taskExecutorFunction` for the queue manager.
2.  In the main bot file (`index.js`):
    -   Import `enqueueTask` and `processQueue` from `lib/queueManager.js`.
    -   Initialize the queue manager, passing the `executeAiderTask` function.
    -   Modify the `@mention` handler (Prompt 8):
        -   Instead of executing directly, create a `taskData` object: `{ userId: message.author.id, commandType: 'mention', commandData: { prompt: extractedPrompt, originalMessageId: message.id } }`.
        -   Call `await enqueueTask(message.channelId, taskData)`.
        -   Reply to the user immediately: "‚è≥ Your request has been added to the queue." (Maybe check queue length first to say "Processing now..." if queue was empty).
    -   Modify other command handlers (`/add`, `/drop`, etc.) IF they need to become queued, long-running tasks (currently they likely don't). `/add-repo` with the clone IS long-running and should probably be queued.
    -   Modify `executeAiderTask` to retrieve the original message/interaction using `originalMessageId` if needed to reply.
3.  Consider triggering `processQueue(channelId)` not just after enqueue, but also periodically or on bot startup for any queues that were left processing (`isProcessing: true`) after a crash.
4.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Modify relevant test files (`mentionHandler.test.js`, `addRepoCommand.test.js` if refactored).
-   Mock `enqueueTask`.
-   Test that command handlers (like `@mention`) now call `enqueueTask` with the correct task data instead of executing directly.
-   Test that an immediate queue acknowledgement message is sent.
-   Integration test: Simulate multiple mentions quickly. Verify they are queued and the (mocked) `executeAiderTask` is called sequentially by the queue manager logic (tested in Prompt 27).
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
