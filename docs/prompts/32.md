Task: `/ls` & `/tree` Commands: Implement `/ls` and `/tree` commands to view repository contents.
Requirements:
1.  Register two new slash commands:
    -   `/ls`: Optional string option `directory` (defaults to repo root).
    -   `/tree`: Optional string option `directory` (defaults to repo root).
2.  In the interaction handler:
    -   Handle `ls` and `tree` commands.
    -   Find the repository document for `interaction.channelId`. If none, reply error.
    -   Retrieve `assignedUserId` and `repoName`. Construct `repoPath`.
    -   Get the optional `directory` argument. Perform basic sanitization (prevent escaping the repo dir, e.g., block `..`, absolute paths). If invalid, reply error. Default to `.` if not provided.
    -   Construct the target path within the repo: `path.join(repoPath, sanitizedDirectory)`. Ensure it's still within `repoPath`.
    -   Use `child_process.spawn` or `execFile` to run the command (`ls -la` or `tree -L 2` - limit depth initially) via `sudo`:
        -   Command: `sudo`
        -   Args: `['-u', assignedUserId, commandName, options..., targetPath]` (e.g., `sudo -u coder1 ls -la /repos/repo1/subdir`)
        -   Set `cwd` to `repoPath` (or maybe `/`).
        -   Capture `stdout` and `stderr`.
    -   If the command fails (non-zero exit, stderr), reply with an error message (e.g., "Directory not found or error listing files.").
    -   If successful, format the `stdout` content (trimming, maybe using code blocks) and send it as a reply. Handle potentially large output (split messages or use file attachment if >2000 chars).
3.  Ensure `ls` and `tree` are installed in the Docker image (Prompt 19) and the `sudoers` file allows `appuser` to run them as `coderX`.
4.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/filesystemCommands.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Mock `child_process` (`spawn`/`execFile`).
-   Mock finding the `Repository` document.
-   Test `/ls` (no args): Assert `sudo -u <user> ls ... <repoPath>` is called. Mock stdout and assert reply contains it.
-   Test `/ls` (with valid subdir): Assert `sudo -u <user> ls ... <repoPath>/subdir` is called.
-   Test `/ls` (with invalid dir like `../`): Assert command is *not* run and an error reply is sent.
-   Test `/tree`: Similar tests for the `tree` command.
-   Test command failure: Mock `spawn` to return error/stderr. Assert error reply is sent.
-   Test large output handling (if implemented).
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
