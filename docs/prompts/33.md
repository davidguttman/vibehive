Task: `/diff` Command: Implement the `/diff` command to show the last bot commit's changes.
Requirements:
1.  Register a new slash command `/diff` (no options needed initially).
2.  In the interaction handler:
    -   Handle the `diff` command.
    -   Find the repository document for `interaction.channelId`. If none, reply error.
    -   Retrieve `assignedUserId`, `repoName`, `channelId`. Construct `repoPath`.
    -   Determine the branch name used for pushes (e.g., `branchName = \`aider/channel-${channelId}\``).
    -   Use `child_process.spawn` or `execFile` to run `sudo -u ${assignedUserId} git diff HEAD~1..HEAD`:
        -   Command: `sudo`
        -   Args: `['-u', assignedUserId, 'git', 'diff', 'HEAD~1..HEAD']` (Note: Assumes the last commit *is* the relevant one. May need adjustment if other commits happen on the branch). Alternatively, `git show HEAD`.
        -   Set `cwd` to `repoPath`.
        -   Set `env` including `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (though likely not needed for `diff`).
        -   Capture `stdout` and `stderr`.
    -   If the command fails (e.g., no previous commit), reply with an error ("No previous commit found or error generating diff.").
    -   If successful:
        -   Get the `stdout` (the diff content).
        -   If the diff is empty, reply "No changes found in the last commit."
        -   If diff has content, send it as a file attachment:
            -   Create a Discord `AttachmentBuilder` with the diff content.
            -   Set the filename to `last_commit.diff`.
            -   Reply with the attachment.
3.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/diffCommand.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Mock `child_process`.
-   Mock finding the `Repository` document.
-   Test successful diff: Mock `git diff` to return diff content in stdout. Assert `interaction.reply` is called with a file attachment named `last_commit.diff` containing the stdout content.
-   Test empty diff: Mock `git diff` stdout to be empty. Assert reply indicates no changes.
-   Test Git error: Mock `git diff` to fail. Assert error reply is sent.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
