Task: Refine Error Handling & Logging: Improve error handling and logging throughout the application.
Requirements:
1.  Review all modules (`index.js`, command handlers, wrapper invoker, Git helpers, queue manager, DB interactions, Python script).
2.  Implement centralized logging: Use a library like `pino` or `winston`. Configure it for appropriate log levels (info, warn, error) and structured logging (JSON). Log to stdout/stderr for Docker compatibility.
3.  Replace `console.log/error` with logger calls.
4.  Error Handling Strategy:
    -   Catch specific errors where possible (DB errors, Git errors, Python script errors, Discord API errors, FS errors).
    -   Distinguish between:
        -   User Errors (e.g., invalid input, repo not found, permissions): Report clearly to user via Discord reply. Log at info/warn level.
        -   Internal/Unexpected Errors (e.g., DB connection lost, script crash, unhandled exception): Report generic error to user ("An internal error occurred..."). Log detailed error with stack trace at error level.
    -   Ensure `try...catch` and `try...finally` blocks are used appropriately, especially around I/O, process spawning, and DB operations.
    -   In `aider_wrapper.py`, ensure exceptions are caught, logged to stderr (stack trace), and a proper failure JSON is sent to stdout.
5.  Sensitive Data: Review logs to ensure sensitive data (decrypted SSH keys, full file paths if sensitive, raw DB errors that might leak info) is *not* logged directly. Log placeholders or summaries instead. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` should never be logged.
6.  Python Script `stderr`: Ensure `stderr` from `aider_wrapper.py` is captured by the Node.js invoker and logged internally (at error level if script failed, maybe debug level otherwise) but *never* shown directly to the user.
7.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   This involves reviewing and refactoring existing code rather than adding distinct features.
-   Enhance existing tests:
    -   Check that appropriate log messages (mocking the logger) are generated for success and failure cases.
    -   Verify stack traces are logged for internal errors.
    -   Verify user-facing error replies are clear and don't leak internal details.
    -   Verify sensitive data isn't present in mock log output.
-   Manual testing: Trigger various error conditions (invalid repo URL, bad SSH key, invalid directory for `/ls`, mention in unconfigured channel) and check bot replies and container logs (`docker logs`).
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
