Task: Autocomplete: Implement slash command autocomplete for file/directory paths.
Requirements:
1.  Modify command registration for `/add`, `/drop`, `/ls`, `/tree` to enable autocomplete for the relevant options (`paths`, `directory`). Set `autocomplete: true` in the option definition.
2.  Add a handler for the `InteractionType.ApplicationCommandAutocomplete` event in `index.js`.
3.  Inside the autocomplete handler:
    -   Get the focused option name and value (`interaction.options.getFocused(true)`).
    -   Get the `commandName` and `channelId`.
    -   Find the repository document for the `channelId`. If none, respond with an empty array `interaction.respond([])`.
    -   Retrieve `assignedUserId`, `repoName`. Construct `repoPath`.
    -   Determine the base directory for suggestions:
        -   For `/ls`, `/tree`: Use the current value of the `directory` option being typed. Default to repo root if empty.
        -   For `/add`, `/drop`: Depends on desired behavior. Could suggest files/dirs from root, or from the directory part of the currently typed path in the `paths` option. Start simple: suggest from root.
    -   Construct the target path for listing (`path.join(repoPath, baseDirForSuggestions)`). Sanitize input.
    -   Use `child_process.spawn` (`sudo -u ... ls -p`) inside the target path. `-p` adds `/` to directories. Capture stdout. Handle errors gracefully (respond empty).
    -   Parse the `ls` output (stdout lines). Filter out unwanted entries (like `.`, `..`, maybe hidden files).
    -   Filter the results based on the currently focused value (`focusedOption.value`). Keep entries that *start with* the typed value.
    -   Limit the number of suggestions (e.g., Discord limit is 25).
    -   Format the suggestions as an array of `{ name: string, value: string }` objects. `name` is what the user sees, `value` is what's sent when selected.
    -   Call `interaction.respond()` with the array of suggestions.
4.  Handle permissions and sanitization carefully when constructing paths for `ls`.
5.  Make autocomplete responsive; avoid long-running operations. `ls` should be fast enough.
6.  Use standard.js style. Run `standard --fix`.
Testing:
-   Create `test/autocomplete.test.js` using `tape`.
-   Mock the `interaction` object (type Autocomplete). Set `commandName`, `channelId`, focused option/value.
-   Mock finding the `Repository` document.
-   Mock `child_process.spawn` for the `ls` call. Provide sample `ls -p` stdout.
-   Test case 1 (Root suggestions): Focused option empty. Assert `ls` is called for repo root. Assert `interaction.respond` is called with formatted suggestions based on mock stdout.
-   Test case 2 (Filtering): Focused option value is "src". Assert `interaction.respond` suggestions are filtered (e.g., only "src/", "src/file.js").
-   Test case 3 (Subdir suggestions for `/ls`): Focused option is `directory`, value is "src/". Assert `ls` is called for the subdirectory.
-   Test case 4 (No repo): Assert `interaction.respond([])` is called.
-   Test `ls` error handling.
-   Ensure tests run via `npm test`.
